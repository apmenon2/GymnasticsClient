# GymnasticsClient

## Purpose
This Java application served as my UIUC CS242 Final Independent Project. I had full reign to design any kind of fully functioning application using any platform. 

## Overview
The Gymnastics Routine Maker serves as both a gymnastics library and routine constructor for male rings gymnasts. Since the project was a proof of theory study, the scope was kept to just a single gymnastics event as it would have been extremely time intensive to find resources for all gymnastics events. The library portion of the application allows for lookup and filtering of any kind of skill in the gymnastics of Code of Points (CoP). The routine builder portion however can be used to add many skills into a single routine to calculate its validity and final starting value or score. 

## Acknowledgements
All skill images and information used in the application were directly mined from the CoP and the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) owns all media.
